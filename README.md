# Real-time_Stock_Analysis_and_visualisations
End-to-end real-time data engineering project that streams live stock prices using Kafka and yfinance, processes data with PySpark, stores it in Snowflake, and visualizes insights in Power BI. This project demonstrates a production-grade pipeline integrating modern tools across ingestion, transformation, storage, and reporting.
